  # Since we develop a library, we want to make sure that it properly runs
  # after installation. We already ran into an issue when some files were
  # forgotten to be included in package_data and it was not caught by tests.

  # So first we run unit tests against raw source code and report coverage.
  - pytest -v tests/ --cov=m2cgen/ --ignore=tests/e2e/
  - coveralls

  # Then we install it as a library, remove source code and run e2e tests.
  - python setup.py install
  - rm -rfd m2cgen/
  - pytest -v tests/e2e/
